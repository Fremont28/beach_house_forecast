Forecasting real estate market for some east coast beach towns 

Beach front owners have good reason to worry with rising sea levels and recent surges of intense tropical storm/hurricanes that have devastated parts of the east coast. In turn, the real estate market in high risk flooding areas could create a housing crisis if these weather patterns continue into the future. 

According to The Guardian, a UK based journalism site, potential flooding threatens 300,000 U.S. coastal homes within the next 30 years. 

An analysis conducted by Zillow and the NOAA found that low-lying states including New York, New Jersey, and Florida are especially at risk for future flooding. Rising seas are obviously a huge threat to the U.S. housing market and could dramatically alter the future density of coastal populations. 

In the deep south, the threat of rising sea levels is already a living reality for Miami residents where sea water regularly floods into the streets (even on sunny days). Many are paying higher rates for flood insurance and some restrictions are being placed on building permits. Further, in some cases, real estate at higher elevations is valued more than houses closer to sea level. 

Valuing East Coast Beach Real Estate

Even with climate warnings, developers continue to build along the U.S coasts. Using data from Zillow, a U.S. real estate website, we can measure how the real estate market is holding-up in popular east coast beach towns. 

Letâ€™s start with Cape May County located on the southern tip of New Jersey. 

Cape May County is essentially split into two parts separated by a bay: Wildwood and Cape May city and its surrounding farm area. 

Wildwood is a slightly run-down beach town lined with ocean front motels and resorts stretching along two-plus miles of beautiful beach leading up to a boardwalk. Even today, Wildwood still retains part of its 1960s/70s retro look and remains a popular place for family vacations. 

On the other side of the bay, the town of Cape May is known for its Victorian style houses (and ghost tours?) and above average food options ranging from southern to Greek fair.  

At its peak and low, the median selling price for a house in Cape May County ranged between $495,750 and $369,000 in September 2010 and July 2015 respectively. 

Over 2016 and 2017, however, the median selling price in Cape May gradually rebounded into the upper $300,000 range and currently hovers at $402,500 (as of June 2018). Based on time series forecasting using an autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA) we expect the future home value in Cape May County to drop to around $391,420 by June 2019.
